- Drug regimens Capomulin and Ramicane have the highest number of of observed timepoints.
- The distribution of male and female mice in the study is almost equal, With male being 51% and female 49%.
- Drug regimens Capomulin and Ramicane have lower final tumor volumes than Infubinol and Ceftamin.
- The correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen is 0.83. Indicating a strong positive correlation. As mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume tends to increase as well.
- The linear regression has a positive slope (0.96) which suggests that there is a positive relationship between mouse weight and tumor volumeâ€”increasing weight corresponds to an increase in average tumor volume. 
- Based on the strong positive correlation and the positive slope of the linear regression model, there appears to be a significant relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume in mice treated with the Capomulin regimen.
